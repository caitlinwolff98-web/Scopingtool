# Archived Documentation

## Purpose of This Folder

This folder contains legacy documentation files from previous versions of the Bidvest Scoping Tool (v1.0 - v3.1). These files have been archived as part of the v4.0 complete overhaul.

## Important Notice

**DO NOT USE THESE FILES FOR CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**

All documentation has been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide:

### → [COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md](../COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md) ←

## Why Documentation Was Consolidated

**Problem:** The repository had 24+ separate markdown files, making it:
- Difficult to navigate
- Hard to find specific information
- Prone to inconsistencies
- Overwhelming for new users

**Solution:** Created ONE comprehensive guide that covers:
- Complete installation & setup
- Step-by-step workflows
- Power BI integration (fully detailed)
- Manual scoping procedures
- ISA 600 compliance requirements
- Comprehensive troubleshooting
- Technical reference
- Quick reference appendices
